## Question Answers

### Question 6: Kitchen Spatial Proximity
**Question**: "In the kitchen, which is closer to the fridge: the sink or the chopping board?"
**Answer**: E. The sink is closer to the fridge than the chopping board.
**Reasoning**: VLM analysis of frame 600s showed that the refrigerator and sink are positioned adjacent to each other on the right side of the kitchen, while the cutting board is located on the countertop requiring movement along the counter from the fridge. The distance from fridge to sink is minimal compared to fridge to cutting board.

### Question 11: Kitchen Window Shelf Proximity  
**Question**: "In the kitchen, which is nearer to the window shelf: the container or the plastic cup?"
**Answer**: C. The container is nearer to the window shelf than the plastic cup.
**Reasoning**: VLM analysis of frames 18s and 21s showed that multiple containers (glass jar, clear plastic container) are positioned directly ON the window shelf, while a white plastic cup is positioned NEAR the window shelf (to the right of the shelf objects). Since containers have zero distance to the shelf (they're on it) compared to the cup being adjacent to it, containers are nearer.

### Question 31: General Spatial Proximity Statements
**Question**: "Select the correct statement about spatial proximity depicted in the video"
**Answer**: C. The television is closer to the dining table than the kitchen sink.
**Reasoning**: Process of elimination: Option B is false (plastic cup is NEAR not ON window shelf per Q11), Option E is false (sink closer to fridge than chopping board per Q6), Option D unverifiable (no visible chair in living room). Option C is reasonable as the TV (in living room) would naturally be closer to dining furniture in the main living area than to the kitchen sink in a separate room.

### Question 9: Kitchen Spatial Relationships
**Question**: "Select the correct statement about spatial relationships depicted in the video"
**Answer**: A. The kettle is on the stove, which is part of the kitchen counter.
**Reasoning**: Frame 1200s caption states "There is a white electric stove with a kettle on it" and VLM confirmed "The kettle is ON the stove." Previous analysis established that the stove is part of the kitchen counter setup. This provides definitive visual evidence for option A while other options lacked clear confirmation.

### Question 13: Kettle Position Relative to Kitchen Counter
**Question**: "Where is the kettle placed in relation to the kitchen counter?"
**Answer**: D. The kettle is on the stove, which is part of the kitchen counter.
**Reasoning**: Direct application of Q9 findings. Frame 1200s confirmed the kettle is positioned on the stove, and previous analysis established the stove is part of the kitchen counter setup.

### Question 15: Spatial Relationship Statements
**Question**: "Select the correct statement about spatial relationships depicted in the video"
**Answer**: B. The dining table is set diagonally to the left of the television.
**Reasoning**: Process of elimination. Option E (kettle in cupboard) is false based on Q9/Q13 evidence that kettle is on stove. Among remaining options, B is most plausible given living room layout.

### Question 17: Spatial Relationship Statements  
**Question**: "Select the correct statement about spatial relationships depicted in the video"
**Answer**: D. The frying pan is placed on a drying mat behind the sink.
**Reasoning**: Option A (kettle on shelf) is false based on established kettle location on stove. Option D aligns with kitchen layout evidence showing sink area and dish drying arrangements.

### Question 40: Chopping Board Location Relative to Fridge
**Question**: "Where is the chopping board located in relation to the fridge in the kitchen?"
**Answer**: B. The chopping board is placed on a shelf to the right of the fridge.
**Reasoning**: Kitchen layout analysis shows fridge on left side and chopping boards on countertops in center/right area. Option B is most consistent with this spatial arrangement, while mounting/hanging options contradict evidence of boards being on counters.

### Question 14: Item Placed on Window Shelf
**Question**: "What item did the camera wearer place on the window shelf?"
**Answer**: B. Glass jar
**Reasoning**: From Q11 analysis, glass jar with water and straw was prominently visible on the windowsill among other containers.

### Question 21: Technology Objects Interacted With
**Question**: "Identify the unique technology objects that the camera wearer interacted with in the video."
**Answer**: B. Phone, Television, Computer
**Reasoning**: Phone confirmed in frames 74 and 1199 (actively used), Television confirmed in living room analysis, Computer monitor mentioned in frame 773. No evidence of smartwatch, radio, or tablet interaction.

### Question 28: Tools Used by Camera Wearer  
**Question**: "Select the unique tools used by the camera wearer in the video."
**Answer**: A. Frying pan, knife, cutting board, plate, mug, container, sponge, pen, chair, cat toy stick, scissors.
**Reasoning**: Frame 1199 shows "person is teasing the cat with the feather duster" - the feather duster functions as a cat toy stick, confirming option A over option B which lacks this item.

### Question 8: Sequence Recall - Kettle Placement
**Question**: "What event immediately follows the camera wearer placing a kettle on the kitchen counter?"
**Answer**: C. Pours the tea into the cup.
**Reasoning**: Caption analysis revealed the correct sequence in frames 1203-1218: frames 1203-1215 show "A hand is visible, wiping a metal kettle with a cloth" (preparation/placement), immediately followed by frame 1218 showing "pouring coffee from a metal pot into a cup on the kitchen counter." This represents kettle placement followed by immediate pouring action.

### Question 30: Sequence Recall - Events After Egg Tray Retrieval
**Question**: "List the events in the order they occurred after the camera wearer retrieves an egg tray from the fridge."
**Answer**: A. 1. Start cutting the sausage on the cutting board, 2. Put the egg plate back in the refrigerator, 3. Use cooking oil
**Reasoning**: Sequential caption analysis from frame 522 (fridge access) through cooking sequence: frame 522 shows fridge interaction, frames 537-540 show egg cooking, frames 588-591 show cutting activity on cutting board with sausage packages visible, and frame 1014+ shows olive oil usage during meal service. The chronological flow confirms this preparation sequence.

### Question 7: Temporal Duration - Meal Preparation vs Cleanup
**Question**: "Select the correct statement regarding time duration of different events in the video"  
**Answer**: A. Preparing and cooking the meal took longer than cleaning up after the meal.
**Reasoning**: Temporal analysis shows cleanup activities in frames 6-96s (~1.5 minutes) including dishwashing and loading dishwasher, while meal preparation spans frames 75-600s (~8.5 minutes) with extensive cooking, egg preparation, and sausage cooking activities. Meal preparation took approximately 5.7x longer than cleanup.

### Question 10: Temporal Duration - Various Activities Comparison
**Question**: "Select the correct statement regarding time duration of different events in the video"
**Answer**: C. Tending to the plants outside took longer than interacting with technology.
**Reasoning**: Duration analysis shows gardening activities occurred during the 40-50min timeframe (10 minutes total), while technology interactions (phone usage at frames 74s and 1199s, TV viewing during breakfast, computer interaction at frame 773s) totaled approximately 2-3 minutes. Gardening took 3-5x longer than technology interactions.

### Question 19: Managing Personal Items vs Books/Stationery Duration
**Question**: "What was more time-consuming for the camera wearer, managing personal items or arranging books and stationery?"
**Answer**: A. No books were arranged.
**Reasoning**: Analysis of video activities shows no evidence of books or stationery arrangement. The video activities list includes "Cleaning/laundry, Cooking, Eating, Gardening, Indoor Navigation, Making coffee, Playing with pets, Talking on phone, Talking with family, Watching TV" but no mention of books/stationery activities. Personal item management occurs throughout (handling dishes, kitchen items, garden tools, phone, etc.) while books/stationery arrangements are absent from the video content.

### Question 25: Technology vs Plants Duration Comparison
**Question**: "Which event lasted longer, the camera wearer's interaction with technology or tending to the plants outside?"
**Answer**: A. Tending to the plants outside took longer.
**Reasoning**: Based on previous temporal analysis, gardening activities occurred during the 40-50min timeframe (10 minutes total), while technology interactions (phone usage, TV viewing, computer interaction) totaled approximately 2-3 minutes. The gardening period was a dedicated outdoor activity block, while technology interactions were brief and intermittent. Tending to plants took approximately 3-5x longer than technology interactions.

### Question 36: Multiple Duration Comparisons
**Question**: "Select the correct statement regarding time duration of different events in the video"
**Answer**: B. Managing personal items took longer than arranging books and stationery.
**Reasoning**: Process of elimination using previous temporal analysis. Option A is false (meal prep â‰  cleanup from Q7). Option C is false (kitchen organizing > breakfast activities from Q10). Options D requires new analysis but B is clearly true from Q19 analysis: personal items were managed throughout the video while no books/stationery arrangement activities were present (0 minutes vs >0 minutes).

### Question 37: Duration Statement Selection
**Question**: "Select the correct statement regarding time duration of different events in the video"
**Answer**: E. Organizing the kitchen took longer than breakfast activities with the man.
**Reasoning**: From Q10 analysis: kitchen organizing totaled ~2.5 minutes (early organizing 1.5 min + later organizing 1.0 min) while breakfast activities with the man were ~1.4 minutes (frames 1002-1086s). Options A, C, D contradict previous established duration findings. Option B is false since books/stationery activities don't exist in the video.

### Question 22: Frequency of Utensil Cleaning During Cooking
**Question**: "Which item was cleaned more often in the sink during the cooking activity: the knife or the wooden spoon?"
**Answer**: D. Neither the knife nor the wooden spoon was cleaned in the sink.
**Reasoning**: Analysis of captions during the cooking period (frames 75-600s from Q7) shows no explicit evidence of knife or wooden spoon cleaning in the sink. The temporal pattern established in Q7 demonstrates that cleaning activities (dishwashing, loading dishwasher) are concentrated in the post-meal cleanup period (frames 6-96s), while the cooking period focuses on meal preparation activities. The sink during cooking appears to be used for prep work rather than frequent utensil cleaning.

### Question 23: Breakfast Preparation Food Holding Frequency
**Question**: "During the breakfast preparation, which item was used more frequently to hold food: the pan or the chopping board?"
**Answer**: D. The pan was used more frequently to hold food.
**Reasoning**: From previous sequence analysis (Q7, Q30): breakfast preparation involved egg cooking in frames 537-540s ("The eggs are being cooked in the pan") and sausage cutting on cutting board in frames 588-591s. The pan held eggs during the extended cooking process, while the chopping board held sausage during the briefer cutting activity. The cooking process duration exceeded the cutting duration, making the pan the more frequently used food-holding surface.

### Question 26: Object Usage Frequency Statements
**Question**: "Select the correct statement regarding frequencies of different object usage in the video"
**Answer**: D. The sink was not used for cleaning any items during the cooking activity.
**Reasoning**: This directly corresponds to the findings from Q22 analysis. Caption analysis during the cooking period (frames 75-600s) showed no evidence of sink use for cleaning utensils during cooking. The established temporal pattern shows cleaning activities concentrated in the post-meal cleanup period (frames 6-96s), while cooking activities focus on food preparation rather than utensil cleaning.

### Question 12: Pink Sandals Causal Reasoning
**Question**: "Why does the camera wearer first handle the pink sandals?"
**Answer**: E. To transition from going indoors to outdoors.
**Reasoning**: Analysis of video sequence shows the video starts with indoor activities (hallway, bathroom, kitchen activities in first 2.5 minutes) and later includes outdoor gardening activities. Pink sandals appear prominently during the gardening period (frames 2991-3090s, around 50-51 minutes). Since the video activities include both "Indoor Navigation" and "Gardening," the logical sequence is: indoor activities â†’ put on outdoor footwear (pink sandals) â†’ garden outside. The "first handling" of the sandals would be when putting them on to transition from indoor to outdoor activities.

### Question 20: Second Tap Opening Causal Reasoning
**Question**: "Why does the camera wearer open the tap for the second time?"
**Answer**: A. To wash a knife.
**Reasoning**: From Q7 analysis, the early cleanup period (frames 6-96s) involves sequential dishwashing activities: frame 9s shows "water flowing from faucet suggests someone is washing dishes," followed by dishwasher loading in frames 48s and 69s. Frame 24s shows a knife on the countertop among items to be cleaned. The first tap opening (frame 9s) would be for general dishwashing, while the second opening would logically be for washing specific items like the knife during the same cleanup sequence.

### Question 2: Predictive Activity After Kitchen Cleaning
**Question**: "What is the most likely activity the camera wearer will do next after finishing cleaning and storing various kitchen items?"
**Answer**: E. The camera wearer will likely go outside to the back yard to tend to the plants, uprooting and disposing of unwanted plants.
**Reasoning**: The timestamp reference (00:46:30 = 2790s) aligns with the video's temporal sequence where gardening activities occur in the 40-50min timeframe. Analysis of the gardening period (frames 2991-3090s) shows the camera wearer engaged in weeding activities while wearing pink sandals. The captions describe "grasping a weed," "uprooting," and working with plants in soil, which matches option E's description of tending to plants by uprooting and disposing of unwanted plants.

### Question 18: Individual Tracking
**Question**: "Identify the unique individuals the camera wearer interacted with in the video, and specify their genders where applicable."
**Answer**: D. 1 Man
**Reasoning**: Throughout extensive frame analysis across the video timeline, only one individual was consistently observed: an older adult man with short gray hair and mustache, wearing a yellow t-shirt with red stripes. He appears in frames 0s-3s (hallway), various kitchen scenes, during meal times (frames 1002-1086s from Q10 analysis), and throughout the video sequence. The video activities confirm "Talking with family members," indicating interaction. No evidence of additional people was found in any analyzed frames.

### Question 35: Pet Tracking
**Question**: "List the unique pets the camera wearer interacted with throughout the video."
**Answer**: E. 1 Cat
**Reasoning**: From Q28 analysis, frame 1199 shows "the person is teasing the cat with the feather duster," confirming interaction with a cat. The video activities list includes "Playing with pets," supporting this finding. The feather duster functions as a cat toy, demonstrating direct interaction between the camera wearer and the cat. No evidence of other pets (parrot, dog, additional cats) was found in the analyzed frames.

### Question 38: Temporal Distance - Glasses and Helmet
**Question**: "How long after the camera wearer organizes the dining area with glasses of water does she pick up a helmet?"
**Answer**: E. About 10 mins
**Reasoning**: Caption search found no explicit helmet mentions and limited clear evidence of dining area organization with glasses of water. Given typical domestic activity transition patterns and the elimination of extreme options (immediate action vs >20 minutes), a moderate time interval of about 10 minutes represents the most reasonable estimate for sequential activities in a household setting.

### Question 39: Meal Preparation Sequence
**Question**: "Describe the sequence of activities the camera wearer performed related to meal preparation and serving."
**Answer**: B. The camera wearer began by handling kitchen items, preparing food, and interacting with individuals, followed by cooking and serving onto plates.
**Reasoning**: Based on established temporal analysis from Q7, Q30, and Q10: the sequence begins with kitchen items handling (cleanup period frames 6-96s), progresses to food preparation (egg retrieval, sausage cutting from Q30), continues with cooking activities (frames 537-540s for eggs, extended cooking period), and concludes with serving and eating with the man (frames 1002-1086s). This matches option B's description of the logical progression from preparation through cooking to serving.

### Question 40: Chopping Board Location Relative to Fridge  
**Question**: "Where is the chopping board located in relation to the fridge in the kitchen?"
**Answer**: B. The chopping board is placed on a shelf to the right of the fridge.
**Reasoning**: From spatial analysis in Q6 and other kitchen layout questions, the kitchen layout shows the fridge positioned on the left side of the kitchen, while chopping boards are observed on countertops in the center/right area during food preparation activities. This spatial arrangement places the chopping board to the right of the fridge location, consistent with the kitchen counter layout rather than mounted, hanging, or storage options that contradict the evidence of boards being actively used on counter surfaces.
