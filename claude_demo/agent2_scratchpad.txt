AGENT 2 SCRATCHPAD - Working from Bottom Up

Current Question: Question 32 - How can you get to the living room from the kitchen?
Key Information: 
- This is a navigation/room_to_room question (TEXT-based, not image-based)
- Different from Question 42 which was image-based navigation
- Need to determine correct text navigation path from kitchen to living room
- Options: A-E with different navigation descriptions

ANALYSIS NEEDED:
- Use established spatial layout knowledge from previous questions
- Kitchen location: Multiple areas (frames 300s stove, 1800s sink)  
- Living room location: Frame 1500s with dining table, TV, couch
- Central hallway system: Frame 0s with tiled floor connecting rooms

NAVIGATION UNDERSTANDING:
From Question 42 analysis: Kitchen -> Central Hallway -> Living Room

SPATIAL LAYOUT EVIDENCE:
- Central hallway system connects rooms (frame 0s, 3s)
- Kitchen areas: frame 300s (stove), frame 1800s (sink)
- Living room/dining: frame 1500s (TV, dining table, couch)
- Navigation pattern: Kitchen -> Central Hallway -> Living Room

OPTIONS ANALYSIS:

**Option D & E: Direct kitchen-to-living room door**
- D: "There is a door to the living room inside the kitchen"
- E: "There is a door to the living room inside the kitchen on opposite side of dining table"
- Evidence from Question 42: Navigation requires going through central hallway
- No evidence of direct connection between kitchen and living room
- FALSE - Both D and E are incorrect

**Options A, B, C: Hallway navigation**
- All involve exiting kitchen and using hallway system
- Consistent with established layout understanding

**MOST LIKELY: Option C**
- "Walk forward and turn left. Walk forward and take the first entrance on the left into the living room"
- Simple, direct path through hallway
- Matches the Kitchen -> Hallway -> Living Room pattern from Question 42

ANSWER: C
