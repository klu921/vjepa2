Here are some tips you should follow. Reread this tip sheet every few questions.

1. Accuracy is your number one objective. Spend as much time and resources as you need. You will receive 1000 points for every question you get correct. Each query to a VLM costs 1 point, each minute you spend costs 1 point. Maximize your points by maximizing accuracy.

2. Query the VLM excessively. Fact check all your work with the VLM, even if you think you've already proven it before. It's better to check twice than to rely on a wrong fact.

3. Sometimes questions will ask about certain events that occur multiple times in the video. Pay attention to temporal terms such as "after", or "before", because you want to make sure the event you're looking at is the correct one.

4. Write down spatial navigation maps if you need them. Explicitly write out timestamp ranges and compare them. Find the start and end points of occurences.
