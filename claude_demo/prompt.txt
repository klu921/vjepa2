**Frame 3:**
The frame shows the kitchen with a sink, stove, and various kitchen utensils. The kitchen has brown tiles on the walls and a window above the sink.

**Frame 4:**
This frame is similar to Frame 2, showing the living room and dining area. A person's hand is visible in the foreground, holding a glass.

**Frame 5:**
This frame is also similar to Frame 2, showing the living room and dining area. A man is sitting on the couch, watching TV.

**Frame 6:**
